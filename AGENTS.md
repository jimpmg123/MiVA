## gstack — AI Engineering Workflow

This block is managed by `gstack-codex`. Do not edit inside this block.

Skills live in `.agents/skills`. Invoke them by name, e.g. `/office-hours`.
Refresh with `npx gstack-codex init --project`.
This repo currently has the `full` pack installed.

## Available skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/office-hours` | YC Office Hours — two modes. Startup mode: six forcing questions that expose demand reality, status quo, desperate specificity, narrowest wedge, observation, and future-fit. |
| `/plan-ceo-review` | CEO/founder-mode plan review. Rethink the problem, find the 10-star product, challenge premises, expand scope when it creates a better product. |
| `/plan-eng-review` | Eng manager-mode plan review. Lock in the execution plan — architecture, data flow, diagrams, edge cases, test coverage, performance. |
| `/plan-design-review` | Designer's eye plan review — interactive, like CEO and Eng review. |
| `/design-consultation` | Design consultation: understands your product, researches the landscape, proposes a complete design system (aesthetic, typography, color, layout, spacing, motion), and generates font+color preview pages. |
| `/review` | Pre-landing PR review. Analyzes diff against the base branch for SQL safety, LLM trust boundary violations, conditional side effects, and other structural issues. |
| `/investigate` | Systematic debugging with root cause investigation. Four phases: investigate, analyze, hypothesize, implement. |
| `/design-review` | Designer's eye QA: finds visual inconsistency, spacing issues, hierarchy problems, AI slop patterns, and slow interactions — then fixes them. |
| `/qa` | Systematically QA test a web application and fix bugs found. |
| `/qa-only` | Report-only QA testing. Systematically tests a web application and produces a structured report with health score, screenshots, and repro steps — but never fixes anything. |
| `/ship` | Ship workflow: detect + merge base branch, run tests, review diff, bump VERSION, update CHANGELOG, commit, push, create PR. |
| `/document-release` | Post-ship documentation update. Reads all project docs, cross-references the diff, updates README/ARCHITECTURE/CONTRIBUTING/CLAUDE.md to match what shipped, polishes CHANGELOG voice, cleans up TODOS, and optionally bumps VERSION. |
| `/retro` | Weekly engineering retrospective. Analyzes commit history, work patterns, and code quality metrics with persistent history and trend tracking. |
| `/browse` | Fast headless browser for QA testing and site dogfooding. Navigate any URL, interact with elements, verify page state, diff before/after actions, take annotated screenshots, check responsive layouts, test forms and uploads, handle dialogs, and assert element states. |
| `/setup-browser-cookies` | Import cookies from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session. |
| `/careful` | Safety guardrails for destructive commands. Warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, git reset --hard, kubectl delete, and similar destructive operations. |
| `/freeze` | Restrict file edits to a specific directory for the session. |
| `/guard` | Full safety mode: destructive command warnings + directory-scoped edits. |
| `/unfreeze` | Clear the freeze boundary set by /freeze, allowing edits to all directories again. |
| `/gstack-upgrade` | Upgrade gstack to the latest version. Detects global vs vendored install, runs the upgrade, and shows what's new. |
| `/autoplan` | Auto-review pipeline — reads the full CEO, design, eng, and DX review skills from disk and runs them sequentially with auto-decisions using 6 decision principles. |
| `/benchmark` | Performance regression detection using the browse daemon. Establishes baselines for page load times, Core Web Vitals, and resource sizes. |
| `/benchmark-models` | Cross-model benchmark for gstack skills. Runs the same prompt through Claude, GPT (via Codex CLI), and Gemini side-by-side — compares latency, tokens, cost, and optionally quality via LLM judge. |
| `/canary` | Post-deploy canary monitoring. Watches the live app for console errors, performance regressions, and page failures using the browse daemon. |
| `/context-restore` | Restore working context saved earlier by /context-save. Loads the most recent saved state (across all branches by default) so you can pick up where you left off — even across Conductor workspace handoffs. |
| `/context-save` | Save working context. Captures git state, decisions made, and remaining work so any future session can pick up without losing a beat. |
| `/cso` | Chief Security Officer mode. Infrastructure-first security audit: secrets archaeology, dependency supply chain, CI/CD pipeline security, LLM/AI security, skill supply chain scanning, plus OWASP Top 10, STRIDE threat modeling, and active verification. |
| `/design-html` | Design finalization: generates production-quality Pretext-native HTML/CSS. |
| `/design-shotgun` | Design shotgun: generate multiple AI design variants, open a comparison board, collect structured feedback, and iterate. |
| `/devex-review` | Live developer experience audit. Uses the browse tool to actually TEST the developer experience: navigates docs, tries the getting started flow, times TTHW, screenshots error messages, evaluates CLI help text. |
| `/health` | Code quality dashboard. Wraps existing project tools (type checker, linter, test runner, dead code detector, shell linter), computes a weighted composite 0-10 score, and tracks trends over time. |
| `/land-and-deploy` | Land and deploy workflow. Merges the PR, waits for CI and deploy, verifies production health via canary checks. |
| `/learn` | Manage project learnings. Review, search, prune, and export what gstack has learned across sessions. |
| `/make-pdf` | Turn any markdown file into a publication-quality PDF. Proper 1in margins, intelligent page breaks, page numbers, cover pages, running headers, curly quotes and em dashes, clickable TOC, diagonal DRAFT watermark. |
| `/open-gstack-browser` | Launch GStack Browser — AI-controlled Chromium with the sidebar extension baked in. |
| `/pair-agent` | Pair a remote AI agent with your browser. One command generates a setup key and prints instructions the other agent can follow to connect. |
| `/plan-devex-review` | Interactive developer experience plan review. Explores developer personas, benchmarks against competitors, designs magical moments, and traces friction points before scoring. |
| `/plan-tune` | Self-tuning question sensitivity + developer psychographic for gstack (v1: observational). |
| `/setup-deploy` | Configure deployment settings for /land-and-deploy. Detects your deploy platform (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions, custom), production URL, health check endpoints, and deploy status commands. |

Repo installs include the full generated skill pack. Heavy browser/runtime binaries stay machine-local in v1.
Installed release: `0.2.0`
